INSIGHTS & CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

SIMILARITIES:
  • Both datasets show strong coffee + pastry associations
  • Tea and chai products frequently appear in rules
  • Scones, croissants, and biscotti are popular pairings
  • Espresso-based drinks have high association potential

DIFFERENCES:
  • Dataset 1: Fewer rules (4) but based on single product pairs
  • Dataset 2: Millions of rules due to larger basket sizes (11.87 avg items)
  • Dataset 2 shows more complex multi-item associations
  • Dataset 1 focused on specific strong patterns

UNIVERSAL TRENDS:
  ✓ Coffee + Pastry pairings are consistent across datasets
  ✓ Tea varieties show strong association patterns
  ✓ Time-of-day affects purchasing behavior (both datasets)
  ✓ Weekday vs Weekend patterns differ (both datasets)

RECOMMENDATION:
  The analysis confirms that association rule mining is effective
  for café inventory management. While specific product pairs may
  differ, the overall pattern of complementary food and beverage
  purchases is consistent across different café locations and times.
